# RFID-Attendence-System
Here is a project I did with four other friends () for RFID class. In this project we implement an RFID based attendence system. Students can tap their ID tags and their time of attendence will be recorded to the memory. All of this was implemented on Arduino. We also implemented LCD outputs to show student informations when the tags are tapped. There are also LED and buzzers to give audio and visual feedback for correct attandence and faulty ones.<br>

The attendence is recorded to the computer in an Excel file automatically.
